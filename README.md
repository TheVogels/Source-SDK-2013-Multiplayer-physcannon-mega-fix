# Source-SDK-2013-Multiplayer-physcannon-mega-fix
This is a modified version of the Half-Life 2 Deathmatch physcannon that makes it upgradable. There is some extra code from my mod that you can delete.
The original file was made by VALVEÂ®

I can't find how to add the Source SDK license so you would need to search that.

Note: Original file was modified from a community repository for Half-Life 2 Deathmatch that fixes the weapons and AI.
